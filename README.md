# \<ft-connect-minimal-site\>

A minimal working example of a website that embeds a FileThis Connect element.





Getting Started



The point of this project is to act as a stepping-stone between running the component hosted on our service to yours. When done, will have tooling needed to embed, and you will have an understanding of what you need to inject into the component, and how to deal with CORS

Get a copy of this GitHub project on your local dev machine. If you are familiar with git and GitHub, you can choose to "clone" the project using:

git clone kkk

An advantage of this method is that you can easily pull down new versions of the project, as they become available.

You can also choose to get a copy of the project by downloading a current snapshot of the sources using:

https://github.com/filethis/ft-connect-minimal-site/archive/master.zip







`@npm install -g bower`

cd ft-connect-minimal

bower install

CORS

Explain what this is. Point at docs. Explain our rules. Explain that we don't yet have self-service config, but just let us know and we will add to your partner account(s).

Running

Served locally using whatever server you like, so long as it is served with the URL: http://localhost:3505/

Must be this address so that our server's CORS rule tells your browser things are okay.
